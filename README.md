# odinCalculator
project for odin making a working calculator with js html and css 
tasks for the future:

    Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though, like: 12.3.56.5. Disable the . button if there’s already a decimal separator in the display.
    Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.
    Add keyboard support!
